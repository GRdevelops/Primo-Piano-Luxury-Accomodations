# PrimoPiano Luxury Accommodations

PrimoPiano Luxury Accommodations is an accommodation rental business in Vieste. They asked for my help to refurbish their website. I used an Envato template and modified it, creating tailored additional pages and sections. I then integrated their booking engine to keep functionalities such as online reservations. It is a fully functional website. Some challenges encountered were: hosting, migration, accessibility, performance optimization and SEO. This was my first coding project.

Seeing the visual improvement from the previous website and the satisfaction of my client was very satisfying to me.

Challenges: Hosting and migration. With the help of my cousin, who is an expert in IT communication, I set up a .htacces file with the 301 redirect links. I then created a backup and uploaded the new files on the hosting platform. The video on the homepage, which is a beautiful video shot by my uncle, was initially too heavy and the loading times were not good, especially on mobile. So I had to find a way to make the file lighter while keeping an acceptable degree of quality. Thatâ€™s where I learned about video compression, how videos work on a website along with webp format, accessibility and more performance optimization.
